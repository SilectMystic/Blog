## My 2023 summer experience

During the summer of 2023, I enrolled in an internship with the company Work Ed as a Cyber Apprentice to explore and learn more about cybersecurity. During this internship I was able to learn multiple things about cybersecurity for example we learned how to use Kali Linux in order to track down a scammer whose full name was Randal Deargon and his address is 4460 Driftwood Pl Boulder, Colorado 80301 and his phone number is (720) 327-3298.

Something else that we did during that internship was to talk to cybersecurity professionals like Michael Woodson from Sonesta Hotels, Raili Taylor from Utah Government, Arleene Lopez from Summit Trails Advisors, and Donna Woods Cyber Instructor which all gave us projects and more experience in fields, and recommendations/help on what to do in our futures by also expanding our networking.
