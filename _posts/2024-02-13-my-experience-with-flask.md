# My Experience on using Flask

## What is Flask?
To start things off first what is Flask? Flask is a Python framework that lets you use normal HTML and CSS with Python combined to make a website dynamic with a new file type called Jinja which is basically HTML with Python available instead of just making a good old regular static website where you can't interact with.

While Using Flask I learned that it was very similar to using Vue.js with the main difference being the language itself since Vue.js as the name says it uses JavaScript since both frameworks are function based meaning that they work mainly by function so it is something one would need to get used to doing.

## Challenges and Learnings from Flask
When I started working with Flask at first it felt easier to work with Vue since in Flask it's using Python which is a language that I fairly understand well compared to when I started working in Vue where I had to guess some stuff because I didn't fully understand what I was doing compared to now. Other than the language being different another huge difference is that you put all Python code in one file instead of making different files for routes and others since in Flask you can set routes and anything else around and in the functions that one makes. One quick example would be the following picture.

After learning what Flask syntax is like I started building a Social Media Website Project using Flask in order to make it usable with a live server. Making this project was simple but it still took me some time since I'm still inexperienced with flask and still learning more about it by use. Some sources that I used to help myself would be W3 Schools and Stack Overflow when I had problems and when I just simply forgot how to do something simple in Python.

## Ending Thoughts
After all my experience with Flask was great and was able to explore what more I can do with Python in Full Stack Development since I'm still a beginner it was a great experience to learn the extent of coding and how far it can take us with creativity and also on how powerful it is when you get comfortable with it.
