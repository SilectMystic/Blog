# The Titanic Incident Casualties

The RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that was claimed to be unsinkable but later on, the ship sank since the design and construction weren't strong enough to hold against crashing into an iceberg killing over 1,500 people in a single night because of the freezing night temperatures on the water. In this blog post, we will go over the casualties that happened in the incident and analyze some information about the Titanic using a list of all passengers on board.

## The dataset
For this investigation we were provided with a dataset of all passengers including their name, fare, class, and if they lived to tell the tale or not.

Using this dataset we were able to analyze it and answer 3 questions that we came up about the Titanic.

## #1 How many survivors were between the classes by male and female?
In the titanic, it was known that during the evacuation like usual, they prioritized women and kids and left many men to die with no chance of survival.

In this graph, we are able to observe how many people between the classes and genders were able to survive. The first class is the one with the most survivors out of all with the third class in second place, and at last with the second class with the least survivors. As mentioned before we can see the trend of females having more survivals than males since they were mainly prioritized over anyone else during the evacuation of the ship, but in the end, we are left to wonder how the second class has fewer survivors than the third class when the third class was at the lowest living level of the ship.

## #2 How much money did each class cost on average?
As explained before the Titanic is a British luxury ship that had the capacity of holding 3,320 people on board. This ship and the incident happened in 1912 when the currency was very expensive so the fare that it would take to be on the Titanic in today's world currency would be nothing but back in the day would be a lot of money even reaching the thousands mark. The Titanic had a total of 3 classes and depending on which one you choose the more expensive it is, having the 3 classes as the cheapest and the first class as the most luxurious class of all would be the most expensive.

The data presented in this graph shows the real price average difference between all 3 classes with the third one below 20, the second one around 22 and the first one around 85 showing that it is the most expensive one during the time, only the people that would be considered rich could afford to pay and go aboard the Titanic.

## #3 What was the average age per gender on board the Titanic?
In the dataset we were given there is a total of 891 passenger information noted. Using this information we were able to find the average between all recorded passengers of how old they were by gender.

Using this information we could see how popular it was by age in their generation and also observe that they had enough money to even board the Titanic which would not be cheap since many people would not have that much disposable money to be able to afford a ticket at a luxury ship like the titanic.

## Conclusion
In the Titanic, there were many casualties resulting in over 1,500 people dying and gave a lot of information on what people were interested in and showed how currency worked back then being very expensive compared to how cheap it is now.
