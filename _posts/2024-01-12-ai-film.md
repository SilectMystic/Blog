# AI in WALL-E: Describe the role of AI in the movie WALL-E. How are AI systems like WALL-E and AUTO depicted in the film? How do they interact with humans, and what functions do they serve in the story?

The Role of AI in the movie WALL-E was to give their robots personalities and accomplish their main goal of completing the specific task they were made for. Because of the AI receiving their personalities, we can see that they can interact with each other and we can also experience multiple times when they started acting out of their own will and not their programming. We can also see at the beginning of the film that WALL-E was following his original programming of taking care of all the trash that the humans left over on Earth even though he already broke through his old programming and generated a lot of human emotions. As mentioned before the AI is shown by using their personalities and what they were originally programmed to do their job. A main point where we get to see that is when we see everyone aboard the Axiom where they are getting served by the robots inside and also we see it on EVE when she goes to Earth for the sole purpose of finding plant life to bring back to the Axiom to start operation recolonize where a plant its a requirement to start it. Robots in WALL-E interact with humans in many different ways for example depending on its programming it just interacts with them with their sole purpose for example as the robots delivering their food and drinks to the Axiom passengers.

# AI Ethics: Analyze the ethical considerations presented in the movie regarding AI and technology. Are there any ethical dilemmas or consequences of AI actions portrayed in WALL-E? How do these issues relate to real-world AI ethics?

Ethical considerations presented in the movie it's presented that AI and the technology they are controlling we can see that they were built and future-proofed in order to benefit humans through various generations down the line and do everything for them plus cleaning up the planet earth they left behind. Some consequences of AI throughout the movie would be that down the line as told before AI and the technology that they control do everything for humans ending with humans becoming obese and not being able to do anything since the robots will do everything for them regarding what they do with an except of some other. Another problem would be AI going rogue against other humans because of some order they were given for example AUTO went rogue to prevent the Axiom from going back to earth and other robots joined AUTO because of priority of order. This issue might relate to the real world by having AI do most tasks for us we won't be able to learn and be better at it since most people will use it to just get past a challenge and also AI would follow its original programming following orders from their top priority like their programmer and follow every direction not taking in mind the consequences.

# Human-AI Interaction: Examine the relationships between humans and AI characters in WALL-E, especially focusing on emotional connections. How does the film show the potential for human-AI bonds, and what does this suggest about the future of AI-human interactions?

The potential for human-AI bonds is very high since the AI even though they are not able to talk well like a real human acts like a real one, making it possible for bonds very likely to happen since they would have connections with both of their emotions. A good example of this would be both EVE and WALL-E with the various passengers of the Axiom that they were able to bond with for the entire duration of the movie. With this, it tells us that in the future if AI is able to mimic human emotions as well as the movie does it will make the bond between them very possible.

# AI's Role in Society: Discuss how the movie envisions the future of society concerning AI technology. What are the benefits and drawbacks of a society heavily reliant on AI, as shown in WALL-E? How does this portrayal compare to our current trajectory with AI integration in society?

This movie envisions the future of society with AI as both positive and negative since we can see the main flaw being that humans will lose all purpose to stay active in their lives and leave it all to the AI but we can also see how useful and helpful AI can be with humans. Even with the huge drawback humanity could still be considered to be with AI since they would need to stay productive and active in order to avoid it all. This view on AI compares with our current trajectory with its integration into our society by having people abusing it to do everything for them and also having people just taking advantage as a quick tool for something they know can do but could take longer.
